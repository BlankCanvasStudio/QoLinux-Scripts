# QoLinux-Scripts
Welcome to Quality of Life Linux Scripts. These are all the scripts I use to make git server, linux, and ssh as useable as possible. I find git to be clunky and when you have a personal git server, its way too many keys. This is how I make my own life (and hopefully yours) way easier!
